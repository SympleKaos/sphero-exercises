# Control Distance Using Time

### Created by [Josh Dirk](https://github.com/SympleKaos)

## Description

Participants will control the distance the Sphero travels by adjusting the Duration parameter of the Roll Action.
The Heading and Speed parameters of the Roll Action will be set to constant values.  The purpose is to help participants
develop a "feel" for how the Sphero moves.

## Requirements

- Sphero
- Lightning Lab app
- Colored poster board or construction paper

## Walkthrough

### Setup

  - Mark starting and end points approximately 1-3 meters apart using colored paper.
    - The marks should be far enough apart that the Sphero does not reach the end point using the initial parameters.
  - Program includes one Roll Action
    - Set Speed to a slow - medium value
    - Set initial Duration to 1 second
    - Set Heading to 0
  - Place Sphero at start point
  - Remind participants to Aim Sphero

### Exercise

  - Explain to participants that the goal is to have the Sphero stop as close as possible to the end point.
  - Explain that for this exercise they are only permitted to adjust the duration parameter of the Roll Action.
  - The first run should be done with the initial parameters.

### Questions & Tips for participants

  - The Duration parameter accepts decimal values which can be used to fine tune the distance.
  - (After getting the correct Duration) Does doubling the Duration also double the distance traveled?
  - When the Duration expires, does the Sphero immediately stop?

### Additional Tasks

  - Ask participants what they think will happen if they keep the Duration they used in the first exercise, but now doubled the Speed.
    - After discussing their theories, have them double the Speed.
    - Did the Sphero travel the expected distance?
    - How do speed and duration affect distance?
